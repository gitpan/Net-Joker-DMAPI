Revision history for Net-Joker-DMAPI

0.04    2014-10-21
        - Loading Data::Dump before using it helps.  I stupidly tested in an
          environment where Data::Dump gets loaded automatically so this didn't
          show up.

0.03    2014-10-21
        - Added new logger attribute, allowing a coderef to be provided to
          receive log messages, for flexible logging however you choose.
        - Compare Joker DMAPI version major version (1.2) only, not the full
          version, or I'll be updating this every five minutes when Joker make
          trivial changes.  (I hope I can rely on them to bump the minor version
          for trivial changes, and bump to e.g. 1.3.00 if they make any more
          significant changes.)

        Bah - POD coverage tests failed because of a couple of undocumented
        methods which ought to have been private.  They are now.

0.01    2014-10-09
        First version released.  Works well enough to send arbitrary queries to
        the API, and whois querying and parsing works well, but needs lots more
        work - more methods to handle common operations (rather than having to
        go lower level and use do_query(), and a test suite.
