Revision history for Net-Joker-DMAPI

0.01    2014-10-09
        First version released.  Works well enough to send arbitrary queries to
        the API, and whois querying and parsing works well, but needs lots more
        work - more methods to handle common operations (rather than having to
        go lower level and use do_query(), and a test suite.
